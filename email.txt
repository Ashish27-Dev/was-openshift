Following our discussion yesterday, I would like to provide a summary of the key points we covered and an update on our progress:

Documentation Progress: Our team has been focused on developing the documentation in alignment with the user stories assigned. We are making steady progress and working to ensure that all requirements are thoroughly addressed.

Sample App Deployment: We encountered some challenges related to the deployment of the sample application on OpenShift. Our team is actively working on resolving these issues.

Development Team Coordination: We have made several attempts to connect with the development team for further support but have not yet been successful. We are seeking assistance with some fundamental aspects and would appreciate any guidance you can provide.

Approach and Base Image Management: We are in the process of evaluating new suggestions regarding base image management and deployment strategies. Our aim is to finalize the most effective approach based on these recommendations.

Design Finalization: We kindly request that you review the existing documents we have submitted and provide your feedback to finalize the design. Your input will be invaluable in ensuring that the design meets all requirements and expectations.

We would be grateful for any additional support or resources that could assist us in addressing these challenges. Please let us know if there are any specific next steps or if you have any further guidance.

Thank you for your continued support and cooperation.
