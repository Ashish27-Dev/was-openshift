Use a text editor to open it:

bash
Copy code
vi /opt/ibm/wlp/usr/servers/<server_name>/config/server.xml
Add <classloader> Section:

Insert the <classloader> section into the server.xml file, inside the <server> element but outside of other nested elements. For example:

xml
Copy code
<server>
  <!-- Other configurations -->
  
  <classloader>
    <classpath>
      <path name="lib/custom-library.jar"/>
      <path name="lib/another-library.jar"/>
    </classpath>
  </classloader>
  
  <!-- Other configurations -->
</server>
Ensure that the paths you specify are correct relative to the server’s classpath or the dropins directory.

Save and Close:

Save the file and close the editor.

Restart the Server:

Restart WebSphere Liberty for changes to take effect:

bash
Copy code
/opt/ibm/wlp/bin/server stop <server_name>
/opt/ibm/wlp/bin/server start <server_name>
3. Alternative Classpath Management
If you don't want to modify server.xml, consider these alternatives:

Place JARs in dropins: Place your JAR files in the dropins directory. WebSphere Liberty automatically detects and includes libraries placed here. The directory path is typically:

bash
Copy code
/opt/ibm/wlp/usr/servers/<server_name>/dropins/
Application-Specific Classpath: Ensure that your application’s WEB-INF/lib directory contains the required JAR files. These JARs will be included in the application's classpath.
